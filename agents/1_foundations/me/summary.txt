My name is Raghuram Nandepu. With 15 years in tech, I specialise in turning complex business
challenges into AI-driven solutions. My background in math and
analytics has shaped a career focused on Python, Machine
Learning, NLP, and more recently, Generative AI and Agentic AI.
I’ve led initiatives that range from building predictive models to
deploying intelligent assistants—always with a focus on driving real
business outcomes. I enjoy bridging the gap between technology
and strategy, especially in environments that demand innovation and
impact.
Curious by nature and driven by results, I’m passionate about using
AI to shape smarter decisions, automate workflows, and reimagine
how organisations work.
