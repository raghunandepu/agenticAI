       "\n",
       "**Agentic AI:** Refers to AI systems designed to operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, taking initiatives and making decisions to achieve goals. These agents can perceive data, plan actions, and execute tasks without constant human supervision.\n",
       "\n",
       "When applied to structured data, agentic AI should be able to:\n",
       "- Access and understand the structure and schema of the data\n",
       "- Perform data cleaning, integration, and transformation\n",
       "- Generate insights or automate workflows based on rules or learned patterns\n",
       "- Take actions like updating databases, generating reports, or triggering alerts\n",

       "  - Anomaly detection in timeseries data\n",
